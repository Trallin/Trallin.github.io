Influenced by geology, institutional frameworks, technology, and market dynamics, certain hydrocarbon fields exhibit a multiple-production-cycles pattern, posing challenges in accurate division of development stages. The precise identification of these development stages holds paramount importance for effective field management and decision support. Existing methods for development stages are well-suited for single-production-cycle hydrocarbon fields but lack applicability to those with multiple cycles. In this study, we formulate a model for hydrocarbon field development stages division based on Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM). To enhance ADAM's performance in capturing ascending and descending production trends, we employ the Savitzky-Golay filter and the multicyclic Hubbert model, respectively, to process production data, and compare the effectiveness of the two methods. With the validation of production data from 58 oil fields and 58 gas fields, Savitzky-Golay filter processed data demonstrate a higher accuracy for ADAM algorithm for development stage division, yielding an average accuracy of 95.24% on oil field and of 93.96% on gas field, showcasing high precision. Notably, the development stages division error for 101 out of the 116 oil and gas fields is within 10%.
