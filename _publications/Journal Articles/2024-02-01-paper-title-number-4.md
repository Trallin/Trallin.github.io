During perforation in ultra-deep wells, the blast shock wave can induce dynamic responses of the perforating tubing, leading to potential downhole accidents such as vibration, deformation, and even fracture of the perforating tubing. To comprehend the dynamic response characteristics of the perforating tubing under blast impact load, we conducted a joint finite element simulation using SolidWorks, Hypermesh, and LS-DYNA. The simulation included deformation analysis, motion analysis, and strength analysis of the perforating tubing. By analyzing these factors, we obtained the change in velocity, acceleration, and equivalent stress of the perforating tubing over time under the blast load. The finite element analysis indicates the following: (a) the bottom of the perforating tubing is susceptible to significant tension compression cycle; (b) the velocity amplitude variation is smallest at the top of the perforating tubing, while the frequency and peak values of velocity changes are maximal at the bottom of the perforating tubing; and (c) the top and bottom of the tubing string are the vulnerable parts of the perforating tubing system.
