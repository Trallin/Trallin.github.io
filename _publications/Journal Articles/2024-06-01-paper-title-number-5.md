Carbonate reservoirs account for 60% of global reserves for oil, making them one of the most important types of sedimentary rock reservoirs for petroleum production. This study aimed to identify key production features that significantly impact oil production rates, enhancing reservoir management and optimizing production strategies. A comprehensive dataset is built from reserves and production history data of 377 onshore carbonate oilfields globally, encompassing features such as production, recovery rate, and recovery degree of the whole lifecycle of an oilfield. XGBoost classifier is trained by K-fold cross-validation and its hyperparameters are optimized by Optuna optimization framework. The results show that XGBoost has the best performance evaluated with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score comparing with decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. Key production features are identified by analyzing the classification feature importance of XGBoost classifier, including build-up stage cumulative production, plateau stage cumulative production, plateau stage recovery rate, plateau stage recovery degrees, and peak production. In conclusion, oilfield reserve size, build-up stage cumulative production, plateau stage cumulative production, and peak production increase, while plateau stage recovery rate decreases, and the plateau stage recovery degree of small-sized oilfields is slightly greater than that of moderate and large oilfields. The research methodology of this study can serve as a reference for studying production features of other types of oil and gas reservoirs. By applying the methodology to low-permeability oilfields, this paper concludes the key production features that are as follows: low-permeability oilfields generally have lower peak recovery rate, lower plateau stage recovery rate, lower decline stage recovery degree, and lower decline stage recovery rate, along with a wide but generally lower range of decline stage cumulative production compared to conventional oilfields.
