I am looking for a PhD position in the field of Petroleum Engineering, Geoscience, and Computer Science in 2025 fall. If you have any available positions, please feel free to contact me directly at [Email](qiguilin1024@163.com).

Short Bio
======
I am a **MS graduate in Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering** from Yangtze University, leveraging a robust interdisciplinary background in **Computer Science (B.S., Qingdao University of Technology)**. My research focuses on integrating machine learning with petroleum engineering to optimize hydrocarbon field development, reservoir analysis, and operational safety. Notable achievements include developing an ADAM-based framework for hydrocarbon stage classification, designing a deep learning model for perforating shock load prediction.

To date, I have authored **8 research articles (6 published, 2 under review)** in peer-reviewed journals, with a **total impact factor of 21.0**.
